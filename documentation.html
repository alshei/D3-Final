            <h1>dataset</h1>
            <p>The dataset for this project can be found <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radhakrishna4/lung-capacity" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. It includes six attributes: lung capacity, age, height, smoke,
                gender, and caesarean. More specifically, these refer to the closing capacity of an individual, their
                age, their height, whether or not the individual smokes, their gender, and whether or not the individual
                was born from a caesarean. The age group of the individuals range between 3 and 19, and their heights
                range between 45 to 85 inches. </p>

            <h1>design process</h1>
            <p>As I learned how to use D3.js from the book, <i>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</i> by Scott
                Murray, I created practice visualizations that are contained within the practice folder of this project.
                They consisted primarily of bar charts and scatterplots and I gained an understanding of how to use
                multiple datasets, dynamics datasets, animations, tooltips, and more. </p>

            <p>Following this practice, my design process for the lung capacity dataset started with putting the data
                into Tableau and comparing different attributes to one another. Age and height both appeared to have
                strong correlation with lung closing capacity as my mockup charts show. I filtered the data to the
                individuals that did not smoke because there were more data points to observe. I also realised that I
                preferred to have height and age on the x-axis and independent variables to the y-axis, lung capacity.
            </p>

            <p><a href="images/chart2_fullsize.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img
                        src="images/chart2_fullsize.png" /></a></p>


            </p>

            <h1>rationale of design choices</h1>
            <p>After deciding that these were the attributes I wished to explore in my visualization, I began to parse
                the data in D3.js and construct my charts. A scatterplot seemed like the most suitable chart type for
                this dataset since each individual point contains information about an individual's height/age and lung
                closing capacity. </p>

            <p>The axes were originally both from 0 to the upper level of lung capacity and height/age, but this left
                too much empty space on the left and bottom parts of the chart. For this reason, I trimmed the range of
                both the x-axis and y-axis to dynamically include the min and max values of each attribute. </p>

            <p>While my points were initally solid dots, I ended up leaning towards my mockup charts and creating rings
                out of them; I felt that doing this allowed the viewer to better observe overlapping data points as they
                did not completely obscure one another. </p>

            <p>I wished to explore multiple attributes in the same chart and so I created buttons to toggle between
                height and age so that the correlation between both attributes and lung closing capacity could be
                observed. Animations were used to make the transitions smooth and appealing to look at, and I included a
                subtle gradient to the data where a more reddish color is used for the lower end of the cc values and a
                more purplish color is used for the higher end of the cc values. </p>

            <p>Finally, I added tooltips to each of the data points so that the viewer might be able to mouseover a
                point and see its exact values. I think this is important to have as an option, even though
                visualizations are made to make data easily digestible at first glance. </p>

            <h1>conclusions</h1>
            <p>Based on the information in the dataset and the way it is portrayed in my visualzation, there appears to
                be a strong correlation between height and lung closing capacity as well as age and lung closing
                capacity. The taller or older an individual is, it is more likely that they have a greater closing
                capacity than an individual that is shorter or younger than them. In other words, lung closing capacity
                appears to increase with height and age. </p>

            <p>I find myself curious to learn more about how lung capacity increases over the course of a person's life
                and wonder how much difference is found after the childhood and adolescent stage of a person's life.
                Because a 19 year old is nearly an adult and most people stop growing in height after their teenage
                years, I wonder if there continues to be a linear growth in lung capacity due to age, or if there is a
                point where the data begins to flatten out due to height. </p>
